        <p class="lead mt-4 text-white">Stock markets and bond markets typically move in opposite directions. In early
            2021, as the 10-Year Treasury Yield rose on expectations of an economic recovery accompanied by climbing
            inflation, the stock markets fell sharply. Therefore, tracking the essential indexes and rates is more
            important than ever.</p>

        <p class="lead mb-5 text-white">This web application is built to collect rates from public websites and update
            the data periodically. Users can easily find the rates they need and save time on searching different sites.
            Feel free to register an account to view all the rates. It is 100% free!</p>
